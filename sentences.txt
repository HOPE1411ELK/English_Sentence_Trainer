My friends and I used to hang out at the mall every Friday.
I used to be really shy, but now I’m much more confident.
They used to go camping every summer, but they haven’t done it in years.
I used to love chocolate, but I don’t eat it much anymore.
She used to be a teacher before she became a writer.
We used to have a lot of fun at the beach when we were kids.
He used to stay up late watching movies, but now he goes to bed earlier.
I used to have long hair, but I cut it short last year.
They used to live in the countryside, but now they live in the city.
You’ve got this!
It’s been a long time since we last talked.
That’s not what I meant at all.
He’s been working on that project for months.
She’s always so thoughtful.
It doesn’t seem like a good idea right now.
You should give it a try.
That’s exactly what I was thinking.
He didn’t expect to be so busy today.
She’s really good at making people feel welcome.
It looks like it’s going to rain soon.
You should have seen her face when she found out.
He could use a little break.
That’s the way I like it.
It’s hard to believe, but it’s true.
You need to stop worrying about it.
He’s not sure if he’s ready for that kind of responsibility.
She always knows what to say to make me feel better.
That doesn’t sound like a good idea to me.
You’ve been working really hard lately.
It’s about time you called me!
He’s been waiting for this moment for a long time.
She always gets things done on time.
That’s the best advice I’ve heard all day.
You’ve made a lot of progress since we last spoke.
He’ll figure it out eventually.
She seems really excited about the project.
That’s something I’ve been wanting to ask you.
You’re not alone in this.
It’s all going to work out in the end.
He doesn’t really know what to do next.
She’s been feeling a bit down lately.
That’s exactly what I was hoping for.
You can always count on him when you need help.
It doesn’t really matter what they think.
He’s got some great ideas for the future.
She doesn’t like to be the center of attention.
That’s not something I would normally say.
You’re going to do great, just trust yourself.
It looks like he’s having a tough time.
She’s been really busy with work lately.
That’s one of the best things about this job.
You really need to give it some thought.
It seems like you’re doing well.
He can’t wait to start the new project.
She’ll be here in just a minute.
That’s the kind of attitude I love to see.
You can tell that he really cares about his work.
It’s easy to get lost in the details sometimes.
He’s definitely not the kind of person to give up easily.
She’s always the first one to lend a hand.
That’s not what I was expecting to hear.
You should have come earlier, we missed you!
It’s really important to stay focused on your goals.
He’s always so calm under pressure.
She knows exactly what she’s doing.
That’s not as easy as it sounds.
You might want to consider taking a break.
It’s easy to see why he’s so popular.
He’s been talking about it non-stop.
She’s always the life of the party.
That doesn’t seem like the right solution.
You’re doing great, don’t worry.
It’s nice to see you in such a good mood.
He’s been looking forward to this all week.
She doesn’t like to make a big deal about things.
That’s exactly how I would have handled it.
You’re always so organized, I wish I could be like that.
It’s amazing how much he’s accomplished in such a short time.
He doesn’t always agree with what I say, but that’s okay.
She’s always so punctual, it’s impressive.
That’s not how I imagined it would turn out.
You really should take some time off.
It looks like it’s going to be a good day.
He really knows how to make people laugh.
She always has the best ideas.
That’s something you should definitely consider.
You can’t always predict what’s going to happen.
It’s not something I’d want to deal with again.
He doesn’t like to be rushed.
She’s been planning for this for weeks.
That’s the kind of thing that can really make a difference.
You always manage to find a solution.
It feels like everything’s finally coming together.
He’s got a great sense of humor.
She seems like she’s really enjoying herself.
That’s exactly why I didn’t want to do it.
You should definitely talk to him about it.
It’s nice to know that someone cares.
He’s been a great help throughout this whole process.
She’s one of the most reliable people I know.
That’s something I’ll never forget.
You’re making amazing progress!
It’s good to see you feeling better.
He’s a bit of a perfectionist, but it works for him.
She always puts others first, which I admire.
That’s a little out of my comfort zone.
You’re the only one who can make this happen.
It feels like everything is falling into place now.
He’s been telling me about this for months!
I’m not sure if I can handle this right now.
It’s been a long day, but I made it through.
I’m really trying to figure things out.
Honestly, I didn’t see that coming.
I could use a little more time to think about it.
Let me know if you need any help with that.
That’s not exactly what I had in mind.
I wasn’t expecting things to turn out this way.
I’ll take your word for it.
I’m not sure how to approach this situation.
I’ve been meaning to ask you about that.
I’m still processing everything that happened.
It’s hard to believe, but it’s true.
I wasn’t sure how to say this, but here goes.
I don’t want to make a hasty decision.
I’ve been thinking a lot about that lately.
I’m really sorry for what happened.
I think I need a break from everything.
Can you believe how fast time is flying?
I think I made the right choice after all.
I can’t quite put my finger on it.
Let me know if anything changes.
It’s not as easy as it seems.
I didn’t realize how much I needed this.
I’m not sure how to handle the situation.
I need to take a step back for a second.
It’s easier said than done.
I’m glad we’re finally on the same page.
I’ve been so busy that I lost track of time.
Honestly, I just want some peace and quiet.
I’m really grateful for your support.
I can’t thank you enough for being there.
I think it’s about time we had this conversation.
It’s been a real rollercoaster, to be honest.
I’m trying my best, but it’s not easy.
I don’t want to jump to conclusions.
It’s been a crazy week, but I’m surviving.
I really need to get my life together.
It’s not what I expected, but I’ll make it work.
I’ll take care of it as soon as I can.
I think it’s time to move on from this.
I’m glad you brought that up.
I’m not sure if I’m ready for this.
It’s a lot to process all at once.
I’ll have to think it through carefully.
I’ve got a lot on my plate right now.
I wasn’t sure if I should say anything, but…
I didn’t expect things to escalate this quickly.
I’m just trying to keep everything together.
I’m not sure what to expect, but I’m willing to try.
I think we should take a step back and reassess.
I didn’t realize how much I’d been holding back.
It’s not always easy to stay positive, you know?
I’ve been juggling a lot of things lately.
I’m still not over it, to be honest.
I’ll need some time to process all this.
I never expected that to happen.
I don’t know if I’m ready for this.
It’s not as easy as it looks.
Can you believe how fast time is flying?
I was wondering if you could help me with something.
I’m really looking forward to this.
I think I’ve made up my mind.
That’s exactly what I needed to hear.
I’ve got a lot on my plate right now.
I’d love to hear your thoughts on this.
I’m not sure how I feel about it yet.
I can’t believe it’s already the weekend.
That was a complete surprise!
I’m still getting used to it.
If I were you, I’d take some time off.
I can’t think of anything better right now.
I’m sorry for being so late.
It’s been a while since I last saw you.
If you need anything, just let me know.
I’m really grateful for your help.
This isn’t what I expected at all.
I could use a little bit of help with this.
What’s been going on lately?
I’ll get back to you on that one.
I’ll give it a try and see what happens.
I’m not sure what to do next.
It’s been a tough week, to be honest.
I’m still not sure if I should go.
I can’t believe how much we’ve changed over the years.
Let me know if there’s anything I can do.
I don’t want to rush into anything right now.
I was just about to call you.
I think I need some time to think about this.
It’s been a bit overwhelming lately.
I was hoping we could talk about it later.
That was a good call.
I think it’s about time to make a decision.
I’m not entirely sure how this works, but I’ll try.
I don’t know if that’s the best option.
I’ll be there in a few minutes.
I can’t wait to catch up!
It’s been a pretty busy day so far.
I’m glad we could finally talk.
That’s not exactly what I had in mind, but it works.
I’ll let you know once I have more information.
I wasn’t sure if I should mention this, but…
Let’s not make a decision just yet.
I’m really tired of dealing with this.
I think I’ve had enough for today.
I wasn’t expecting that at all!
I’ll keep that in mind for next time.
I’m trying to stay positive, but it’s hard.
I’m not sure if I’ll be able to make it.
Let me know if you want to grab a coffee sometime.
It’s been a long day, but I’m glad it’s over.
I can’t believe we’re already halfway through the year.
I’m not really sure what’s going on.
I’m really looking forward to this weekend.
I don’t think that’s the best idea right now.
I’ll let you know if I’m free later.
I’m feeling kind of off today.
I think we should hold off on that for a while.
I’m just trying to get through the day.
I can’t thank you enough for everything.
I’m so glad you brought that up.
I don’t know how I would have done it without you.
It’s been a rough couple of days, but I’m getting through it.
I didn’t expect things to go this way.
I’ll figure it out sooner or later.
I think we should take a step back and rethink this.
I’m not sure if I agree with that.
I need to clear my head for a second.
It’s not a big deal, don’t worry about it.
I’ll take care of it as soon as I can.
I’ve been meaning to ask you about something.
I don’t feel like doing anything today.
I think I’m going to call it a day.
I’ll do my best to make it on time.
I wasn’t expecting it to be this complicated.
I’m just trying to stay on top of everything.
I’ll need a little more time to get things together.
It’s harder than I thought it would be.
I think we should focus on the positive side.
I really need to take a break.
I think we’re getting closer to a solution.
It’s been a bit of a struggle, but I’m getting there.
I’m still thinking about what you said.
I’m glad we could finally make it happen.
I can’t wait to see what happens next.
I need to be more careful with this.
I’m not sure what the best approach is.
I’ve been feeling kind of down lately.
I’ll have to check my schedule.
I think this is going to take a little longer than expected.
I really appreciate your patience.
I’ll need some time to adjust.
I’m not sure if I’m the right person to ask about this.
It’s hard to believe, but it’s true.
I think we should talk about this some more.
I’m feeling much better now, thank you.
I think it’s time to take the next step.
It feels like I’m constantly running out of time.
I’ll get back to you once I figure it out.
It’s hard to see the bigger picture right now.
I don’t want to regret this later.
I’m really looking forward to what comes next.
I’ve been putting this off for too long.
I don’t know if I’m the best person for the job, but I’ll try.
I need to take a deep breath and relax for a moment.
It’s been hard to find the motivation lately.
I wasn’t expecting it to be this complicated.
I’m glad we finally got this out in the open.
I’m just trying to take things one day at a time.
I’ll be honest, I’m a little nervous about this.
It’s not the easiest thing to deal with, but I’ll manage.
I think it’s time to let go of the past.
I’m trying to stay focused and not get distracted.
I didn’t expect to be in this situation, to be honest.
I’m just trying to make the best of things.
It’s been tough, but I’m pushing through.
I’m still processing everything that’s happened.
I’ll need to double-check before I confirm anything.
I’ve been feeling a little off lately.
I think it’s time to move forward.
I’m trying to stay hopeful, even though it’s difficult.
I’m not sure what to say right now, but I’m here for you.
I didn’t expect to learn so much from this experience.
I’ll let you know when I’ve figured it out.
I’m not sure if I’m the right person to ask.
Sorry I missed your message earlier.
Thanks for checking in on me.
Do you want me to come with you?
I’ll see what I can do about that.
Let me know if anything comes up.
I had no idea that was happening.
If I were you, I’d probably wait.
Let’s just stay in and relax tonight.
I’ve been looking forward to this all week.
I’m trying to stay focused, but it’s hard.
I really appreciate your understanding.
Could we possibly reschedule for another time?
I hope I didn’t keep you waiting too long.
I wasn’t expecting that to happen.
I know how that feels — I’ve been there too.
It’s not what I wanted, but I’ll manage.
Let me think about it for a moment.
Thanks again for being so patient.
I don’t want to rush into anything right now.
Can I ask you something kind of personal?
I’ll be honest — I’m not really sure.
Do you have a second to talk?
Would it be okay if I joined you?
That must have been really difficult for you.
I didn’t mean to come across as rude.
I’ve heard so many good things about that place.
Let’s catch up soon — it’s been too long.
I’m not quite ready to talk about it yet.
I just need some time to clear my head.
That’s definitely something worth thinking about.
Thanks for pointing that out to me.
I was just about to send you a message.
Let’s not make a big deal out of it.
I’d love to hear more about that.
Let me double-check before I confirm.
That wasn’t what I was expecting at all.
I can’t say for sure, but I’ll find out.
I’m so glad we got to talk today.
I’ll do my best to make it on time.
Could you explain that a little more?
I’ve never really thought about it that way.
I’m not sure if that’s a good idea right now.
Thanks for being honest with me.
It might take a little time, but I’ll try.
That’s one way to look at it, I guess.
I’ll take a look when I have a moment.
I’m happy to help however I can.
Let’s wait and see how it goes.
Let me know if you need backup.
I appreciate you checking in like that.
I didn’t mean to make things awkward.
Can we talk about something else for now?
Let’s focus on what we can control.
It’s okay to feel unsure sometimes.
I’m doing the best I can with what I have.
Let’s figure this out together.
Thanks for sticking with me through this.
I’m not sure what else I can say.
That came out wrong — sorry about that.
I was just thinking about you.
You’ve been on my mind lately.
It means a lot that you said that.
Let me sleep on it and get back to you.
I could use a little break right now.
I don’t want to say something I’ll regret.
It’s okay to take some time for yourself.
Let me know what you decide.
I’m glad you brought that up.
There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you.
We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.
It’s not the end of the world — we’ll figure it out.
Can I ask for your opinion on something?
I’ve got a lot going on at the moment.
Thanks for being so understanding about this.
That’s really thoughtful of you, thank you.
I didn’t mean to put pressure on you.
I need some time to process everything.
Let’s talk when you’re feeling better.
I really value your perspective.
This might take longer than we thought.
I’ll let you know as soon as I hear anything.
You don’t have to explain everything to me.
I’m just glad you’re okay.
That sounds like a tough decision to make.
I’ll support you either way.
Can we take a few minutes to talk privately?
I’ve been struggling with that too lately.
Let’s keep this between us, okay?
I think we’re on the same page.
If something changes, please tell me.
I’m just trying to figure things out.
You don’t have to go through this alone.
I’ll be here if you need someone to talk to.
Thanks for listening — I really needed that.
Let’s try to stay positive and move forward.
I’m here for you, no matter what.
That’s not an easy thing to admit.
You handled that really well, by the way.
Let me know if there’s anything I can do.
Good morning!
How’s it going?
Not much, just relaxing.
What’s up?
Long time no see!
I’m running late.
I need coffee.
Let’s get going.
What’s the plan for today?
Did you sleep well?
I haven’t seen you in ages.
It’s been a really long day.
I’m not in the mood for that right now.
Can we talk about this later?
Do you want to grab something to eat?
I was just about to call you.
Sorry, I didn’t catch what you said.
I completely forgot about that.
That’s exactly what I was thinking.
Let me know if you need anything.
Are you free this weekend?
Let me check my schedule.
I don’t really feel like going out today.
We should hang out sometime soon.
I’ve been meaning to call you.
I’m not sure if I can make it.
Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it.
I’m just taking it easy today.
I’ll be there in about ten minutes.
Let me know when you’re on your way.
I didn’t get much sleep last night.
It’s been really busy at work lately.
Let’s keep in touch.
I don’t have time to explain right now.
That sounds like a great idea.
Do you want to come with us?
I’m not feeling very well today.
I’ll text you when I get there.
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt you.
I hope you’re having a good day.
Can I ask you something personal?
I’ll think about it and get back to you.
Is there anything I can do to help?
I had a really good time today.
I’m totally fine with whatever you decide.
Let me grab my coat and we’ll go.
I can’t believe how fast time flies.
I’ve been really stressed out lately.
It’s not a big deal, don’t worry about it.
I’m just not sure what to do anymore.
It might be better to wait until tomorrow.
That’s not what I meant at all.
Do you have any recommendations?
I’d love to, but I already made plans.
I’m still thinking it over.
That’s actually a really good question.
Would you mind repeating that?
I’ll take care of it later.
I’ve heard that place is really nice.
I’m kind of in a rush right now.
I totally forgot you mentioned that.
I really need to get some rest.
It’s been a while since we caught up.
That’s exactly what I was going to say.
I’ve got a lot on my mind right now.
Sorry for the short notice.
Thanks for letting me know.
I really don’t feel like dealing with this.
I don’t think that’s such a good idea.
I’ll let you know if anything changes.
I’m just trying to stay positive.
We’ll figure it out together.
Let’s not worry about that right now.
I’ll be right back, just a sec.
We should do this again sometime.
I totally understand where you’re coming from.
I hope everything works out for you.
I didn’t mean for it to come out that way.
Let’s just agree to disagree.
There’s no need to rush.
You’ve been a big help, thank you.
Let’s meet up later this week.
I’ll explain everything when I see you.
This might sound weird, but hear me out.
I’ll try to make it if I can.
I really enjoyed our conversation.
Could you hold on for a second?
Can I get back to you on that?
I’d rather not say, if that’s okay.
I’ll think about it and let you know.
That’s not how I see it.
Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you.
Let’s take a break and come back to it.
You’ve got this — I believe in you.
I didn’t expect things to go like this.
That’s a tough one, I’ll have to think about it.
I’m not sure if that’s true.
Let’s just play it by ear.
Thanks again for everything.
No worries, it happens to everyone.
I’m glad we talked.
Let me know how it goes.
Sorry I took so long to reply.
It means a lot to me, thank you.
I’ll check and get back to you.
This isn’t a good time to talk.
It’s okay, take your time.
I’ve been waiting for this all day.
That’s exactly how I feel.
I’m proud of you — keep it up.
I’m so tired.
I’m starving.
I’m bored.
I’m in a good mood today.
That’s so annoying.
Can you help me with this?
Could you give me a hand?
Do you mind if I borrow this?
Would you mind closing the window?
Can I ask you a quick question?
That makes sense.
I totally agree.
I feel the same way.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, exactly!
Wanna hang out later?
Let’s grab lunch.
How about a movie tonight?
Do you feel like going for a walk?
Let’s just chill at home.
How much is this?
Do you have this in a different size?
I’m just browsing, thanks.
I’ll take it.
Can I return this if it doesn’t fit?
Can I call you back?
I’ll text you later.
Sorry, I missed your call.
Just a sec, let me check.
Hold on a second.
Dinner’s ready!
Can you do the dishes?
Don’t forget to take out the trash.
I’ll clean up later.
Let’s watch something on Netflix.
Did you hear the news?
What did you do over the weekend?
The weather’s been crazy lately.
Time flies, doesn’t it?
That reminds me of something funny.
I’ll be right there.
Just a moment, please.
I’m on my way.
I overslept.
I’m heading out now.
Let me know.
Sounds good to me.
I’ll think about it.
I’m not sure yet.
I’ll let you know later.
What do you think?
That’s a good idea.
I’m fine either way.
It doesn’t matter to me.
Whatever works for you.
That’s interesting.
I didn’t know that.
No way! Really?
You’ve got to be kidding.
I can’t believe it!
Sorry, I wasn’t paying attention.
Can you say that again?
I don’t get it.
What does that mean?
Oh, now I see.
I’m hungry. Let’s eat something.
Want something to drink?
I’m full.
I need to go grocery shopping.
We’re out of milk.
Let’s take a break.
Just five more minutes.
I’m almost done.
It’s taking longer than I expected.
I need more time.
I’m not feeling well.
I have a headache.
I think I caught a cold.
I’m going to lie down.
I need some fresh air.
Take care.
Have a good one!
Talk to you later.
See you around.
Let’s catch up soon.
Do you have any rooms available tonight?
I’d like to check in, please.
Can I see the menu, please?
What time does the museum open?
How much is a ticket for one adult?
Is this seat taken?
I think I’m lost. Can you help me?
Do you speak English?
Could you recommend a good local restaurant?
What’s the best way to get to the airport?
I’d like a table for two, please.
Could I get this to go?
Where can I buy a subway ticket?
Is it within walking distance?
How long does it take to get there?
Excuse me, where’s the nearest ATM?
Is there a restroom nearby?
Can you take a picture for me?
I’m just looking, thank you.
Do you take credit cards?
Could you write that down for me?
Can I try this on?
I think you gave me the wrong change.
I’d like to make a reservation.
Is there Wi-Fi here?
Can I have the check, please?
What time is check-out?
Do you have a map of the city?
Is this the line for the bus to downtown?
Can I get a window seat?
What’s the local specialty?
Can I leave my luggage here for a few hours?
Is it safe to walk around here at night?
Can you call a taxi for me?
Where’s the nearest convenience store?
What platform does the train leave from?
Does this bus go to the station?
How often do the trains run?
I’d like to buy a round-trip ticket.
Do I need to transfer?
Where can I exchange currency?
Can I get this in a different size?
Does this come in other colors?
I’m allergic to nuts.
Could I get this without onions?
Do you have any vegetarian options?
I’ll have the same as that.
What time does the next tour start?
Can I pay in cash?
Is service included?
No way! You actually did it?
Seriously? I thought you were joking.
I know, right? That movie was amazing!
Totally. I couldn’t agree more.
I get it. You just needed a break.
No kidding! I didn’t expect that at all.
That makes sense. Now I understand.
Now I get it. You were trying to help.
Oh, I see. So that’s what happened.
Good for you! You finally passed the test.
Guess what? I got the job!
You know what? I think I’m gonna move.
Let me tell you something. He’s not what he seems.
To be honest, I’m not really into parties.
By the way, have you seen my keys?
Fair enough. You’ve got a point.
Whatever. Do what you want.
Not really. I’m kind of tired today.
Kind of. I mean, I’m not sure yet.
Maybe. It depends on how I feel tomorrow.
Wanna grab a bite after work?
How about we watch a movie tonight?
Are you up for a road trip this weekend?
Let’s give it a shot. We’ve got nothing to lose.
Sounds good to me. Let’s do it!
I’m not really into that kind of stuff.
Maybe some other time. I’m pretty busy today.
I’ll think about it. Thanks for the offer.
I’m kinda busy right now. Can we talk later?
I’m gonna pass. Not really my thing.
Thanks, I really appreciate it.
Don’t worry. It’s not a big deal.
Hang in there. Things will get better.
Take it easy. You’ve done enough.
You’ve got this! I believe in you.
What are you up to?
Not much. Just chilling.
Long time no see! How have you been?
Can’t complain. Life’s been good.
That’s awesome! I’m happy for you.
I’m just not feeling it today.
It is what it is.
I messed up. I should’ve done better.
